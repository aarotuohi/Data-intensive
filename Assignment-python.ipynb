    "# Data-Intensive Programming - Group assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **Python** version of the assignment. Switch to the Scala version, if you want to do the assignment in Scala.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all tasks, add your solutions to the cells following the task instructions. You are free to add new cells if you want.<br>\n",
    "The example outputs, and some additional hints are given in a separate notebook in the same folder as this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget to **submit your solutions to Moodle** once your group is finished with the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic tasks (compulsory)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are in total nine basic tasks that every group must implement in order to have an accepted assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic task 1 is a separate task, and it deals with video game sales data. The task asks you to do some basic aggregation operations with Spark data frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other basic coding tasks (basic tasks 2-8) are all related and deal with data from [https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000/5](https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000/5) that contains information about events in [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) matches in five European leagues during the season 2017-18. The tasks ask you to calculate the results of the matches based on the given data as well as do some further calculations. Special knowledge about football or the leagues is not required, and the task instructions should be sufficient in order to gain enough context for the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the basic task 9 asks some information on your assignment working process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced tasks (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are in total of four advanced tasks that can be done to gain some course points. Despite the name, the advanced tasks may or may not be harder than the basic tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advanced task 1 asks you to do all the basic tasks in an optimized way. It is possible that you gain some points from this without directly trying by just implementing the basic tasks efficiently. Logic errors and other issues that cause the basic tasks to give wrong results will be taken into account in the grading of the first advanced task. A maximum of 2 points will be given based on advanced task 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other three advanced tasks are separate tasks and their implementation does not affect the grade given for the advanced task 1.<br>\n",
    "Only two of the three available tasks will be graded and each graded task can provide a maximum of 2 points to the total.<br>\n",
    "If you attempt all three tasks, clearly mark which task you want to be used in the grading. Otherwise, the grader will randomly pick two of the tasks and ignore the third.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced task 2 continues with the football data and contains further questions that are done with the help of some additional data.<br>\n",
    "Advanced task 3 deals with some image data and the questions are mostly related to the colors of the pixels in the images.<br>\n",
    "Advanced task 4 asks you to do some classification related machine learning tasks with Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to gain partial points from the advanced tasks. I.e., if you have not completed the task fully but have implemented some part of the task, you might gain some appropriate portion of the points from the task. Logic errors, very inefficient solutions, and other issues will be taken into account in the task grading.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment grading\n",
    "\n",
    "Failing to do the basic tasks, means failing the assignment and thus also failing the course!<br>\n",
    "\"A close enough\" solutions might be accepted => even if you fail to do some parts of the basic tasks, submit your work to Moodle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accepted assignment submissions will be graded from 0 to 6 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum grade that can be achieved by doing only the basic tasks is 2/6 points (through advanced task 1)."

    "\n",
    "In a football match both teams have 11 players on the playing field or pitch at the start of the match. Each team also have some number of reserve players on the bench at the start of the match. The teams can make up to three substitution during the match where they switch one of the players on the field to a reserve player. (Currently, more substitutions are allowed, but at the time when the data is from, three substitutions were the maximum.) Any player starting the match as a reserve and who is not substituted to the field during the match does not play any minutes and are not considered involved in the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task the length of each match should be estimated with the following procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only the additional time added to the second half of the match should be considered. I.e., the length of the first half is always considered to be 45 minutes.\n",
    "- The length of the second half is to be considered as the last event of the half rounded upwards towards the nearest minute.\n",
    "    - I.e., if the last event of the second half happens at 2845 seconds (=47.4 minutes) from the start of the half, the length of the half should be considered as 48 minutes. And thus, the full length of the entire match as 93 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A personal plus-minus statistics for each player can be calculated using the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a goal was scored by the player's team when the player was on the field, `add 1`\n",
    "- If a goal was scored by the opponent's team when the player was on the field, `subtract 1`\n",
    "- If a goal was scored when the player was a reserve on the bench, `no change`\n",
    "- For any event that is not a goal, or is in a match that the player was not involved in, `no change`\n",
    "- Any substitutions is considered to be done at the start of the given minute.\n",
    "    - I.e., if the player is substituted from the bench to the field at minute 80 (minute 35 on the second half), they were considered to be on the pitch from second 2100.0 on the 2nd half of the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "The target of the task is to use the football event data and the additional datasets to determine the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The players with the most total minutes played in season 2017-2018 for each player role\n",
    "    - I.e., the player in Goalkeeper role who has played the longest time across all included leagues. And the same for the other player roles (Defender, Midfielder, and Forward)\n",
    "    - Give the result as a data frame that has the following columns:\n",
    "        - `role`: the player role\n",
    "        - `player`: the full name of the player, i.e., the first name combined with the last name\n",
    "        - `birthArea`: the birth area of the player\n",
    "        - `minutes`: the total minutes the player played during season 2017-2018\n",
    "- The players with higher than `+65` for the total plus-minus statistics in season 2017-2018\n",
    "    - Give the result as a data frame that has the following columns:\n",
    "        - `player`: the full name of the player, i.e., the first name combined with the last name\n",
    "        - `birthArea`: the birth area of the player\n",
    "        - `role`: the player role\n",
    "        - `plusMinus`: the total plus-minus statistics for the player during season 2017-2018\n",
    "\n",
    "It is advisable to work towards the target results using several intermediate steps."

    "\n",
    "This advanced task involves loading in PNG image data and complementing JSON metadata into Spark data structure. And then determining the colors of the pixels in the images, and finding the answers to several color related questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The folder `assignment/openmoji/color` in the [Shared container](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Storage/ContainerMenuBlade/~/overview/storageAccountId/%2Fsubscriptions%2Fe0c78478-e7f8-429c-a25f-015eae9f54bb%2FresourceGroups%2Ftuni-cs320-f2024-rg%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Storage%2FstorageAccounts%2Ftunics320f2024gen2/path/shared/etag/%220x8DBB0695B02FFFE%22/defaultEncryptionScope/%24account-encryption-key/denyEncryptionScopeOverride~/false/defaultId//publicAccessVal/None) contains collection of PNG images from [OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/) project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON Lines formatted file `assignment/openmoji/openmoji.jsonl` contains metadata about the image collection. Only a portion of the images are included as source data for this task, so the metadata file contains also information about images not considered in this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data description and helper functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The image data considered in this task can be loaded into a Spark data frame using the `image` format: [https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.0/ml-datasource.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.0/ml-datasource.html). The resulting data frame contains a single column which includes information about the filename, image size as well as the binary data representing the image itself. The Spark documentation page contains more detailed information about the structure of the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using the images as source data for machine learning tasks, the binary image data is accessed directly in this task.<br>\n",
    "You are given two helper functions to help in dealing with the binary data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Function `toPixels` takes in the binary image data and the number channels used to represent each pixel.\n",
    "    - In the case of the images used in this task, the number of channels match the number bytes used for each pixel.\n",
    "    - As output the function returns an array of strings where each string is hexadecimal representation of a single pixel in the image.\n",
    "- Function `toColorName` takes in a single pixel represented as hexadecimal string.\n",
    "    - As output the function returns a string with the name of the basic color that most closely represents the pixel.\n",
    "    - The function uses somewhat naive algorithm to determine the name of the color, and does not always give correct results.\n",
    "    - Many of the pixels in this task have a lot of transparent pixels. Any such pixel is marked as the color `None` by the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of the given functions it is possible to transform the binary image data to an array of color names without using additional libraries or knowing much about image processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metadata file given in JSON Lines format can be loaded into a Spark data frame using the `json` format: [https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.0/sql-data-sources-json.html](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.0/sql-data-sources-json.html). The attributes used in the JSON data are not described here, but are left for you to explore. The original regular JSON formatted file can be found at [https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/blob/master/data/openmoji.json](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/blob/master/data/openmoji.json).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "The target of the task is to combine the image data with the JSON data, determine the image pixel colors, and the find the answers to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which four images have the most colored non-transparent pixels?\n",
    "- Which five images have the lowest ratio of colored vs. transparent pixels?\n",
    "- What are the three most common colors in the Finnish flag image (annotation: `flag: Finland`)?\n",
    "    - And how many percentages of the colored pixels does each color have?\n",
    "- How many images have their most common three colors as, `Blue`-`Yellow`-`Black`, in that order?\n",
    "- Which five images have the most red pixels among the image group `activities`?\n",
    "    - And how many red pixels do each of these images have?\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be advisable to test your work-in-progress code with a limited number of images before using the full image set.<br>\n",
    "You are free to choose your own approach to the task: user defined functions with data frames, RDDs/Datasets, or combination of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the currently the Python helper functions do not exactly match the Scala versions, and thus the answers to the questions might not quite match the given example results in the example output notebook."

    "- The main task is to train and test a machine learning model with [Random forest classifier](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.0/ml-classification-regression.html#random-forests) in six different cases:\n",
    "    - Predict the month (1-12) using the three weather measurements (temperature, humidity, and wind speed) as input\n",
    "    - Predict the month (1-12) using the three power measurements (tenants, maintenance, and solar panels) as input\n",
    "    - Predict the month (1-12) using all seven measurements (weather values, power values, and price) as input\n",
    "    - Predict the hour of the day (0-23) using the three weather measurements (temperature, humidity, and wind speed) as input\n",
    "    - Predict the hour of the day (0-23) using the three power measurements (tenants, maintenance, and solar panels) as input\n",
    "    - Predict the hour of the day (0-23) using all seven measurements (weather values, power values, and price) as input\n",
    "- For each of the six case you are asked to:\n",
    "    1. Clean the source dataset from rows with missing values.\n",
    "    2. Split the dataset into training and test parts.\n",
    "    3. Train the ML model using a Random forest classifier with case-specific input and prediction.\n",
    "    4. Evaluate the accuracy of the model with Spark built-in multiclass classification evaluator.\n",
    "    5. Further evaluate the accuracy of the model with a custom build evaluator which should do the following:\n",
    "        - calculate the percentage of correct predictions\n",
    "            - this should correspond to the accuracy value from the built-in accuracy evaluator\n",
    "        - calculate the percentage of predictions that were at most one away from the correct predictions taking into account the cyclic nature of the month and hour values:\n",
    "            - if the correct month value was `5`, then acceptable predictions would be `4`, `5`, or `6`\n",
    "            - if the correct month value was `1`, then acceptable predictions would be `12`, `1`, or `2`\n",
    "            - if the correct month value was `12`, then acceptable predictions would be `11`, `12`, or `1`\n",
    "        - calculate the percentage of predictions that were at most two away from the correct predictions taking into account the cyclic nature of the month and hour values:\n",
    "            - if the correct month value was `5`, then acceptable predictions would be from `3` to `7`\n",
    "            - if the correct month value was `1`, then acceptable predictions would be from `11` to `12` and from `1` to `3`\n",
    "            - if the correct month value was `12`, then acceptable predictions would be from `10` to `12` and from `1` to `2`\n",
    "        - calculate the average probability the model predicts for the correct value\n",
    "            - the probabilities for a single prediction can be found from the `probability` column after the predictions have been made with the model\n",
    "- As the final part of this advanced task, you are asked to do the same experiments (training+evaluation) with two further cases of your own choosing:\n",
    "    - you can decide on the input columns yourself\n",
    "    - you can decide the predicted attribute yourself\n",
    "    - you can try some other classifier other than the random forest one if you want\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases you are free to choose the training parameters as you wish.<br>\n",
    "Note that it is advisable that while you are building your task code to only use a portion of the full 13-month dataset in the initial experiments."
